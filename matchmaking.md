# Quick Match Implementation

## Objective
Implement a **rapid matchmaking system** allowing players to find opponents automatically by clicking a **"Quick Match"** button.

## Core Features

### 1. Matchmaking Queue
- When a player clicks "Quick Match", they enter a **waiting queue**
- If they are the **first player** in the queue, they wait for an opponent
- If another player clicks "Quick Match" while someone is already waiting, a **match is instantly created**

### 2. Match Creation and Recording
- Once two players are found, a **match is recorded in the database** with both player IDs
- Players are then **automatically redirected** to the match interface

### 3. Cancellation Management
- If a waiting player **cancels** before finding an opponent, they are removed from the queue

## Technical Requirements and Integration

### Database Connection
- All matches and players must be **properly recorded and retrieved**

### Integration with Existing Code
- The system must cleanly integrate with **existing functions and hooks**

### Real-time Processing
- Logic must **detect in real-time** when a second player joins and immediately trigger match creation

### Seamless Navigation
- After confirmation, players must be **automatically redirected** to the match page

## Process Summary
1. Player clicks "Quick Match" → They **join the waiting queue**
2. If another player is already waiting → **Match is created and recorded**
3. Both players are **redirected to the match interface**
4. If a player cancels before being paired → They are **removed from the queue**

This system should be **fast, smooth, and well-synchronized** with the database.
